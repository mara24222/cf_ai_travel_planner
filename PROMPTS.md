AI Prompts Used During Development

This file documents the AI-assisted prompts and questions used while building the AI Travel Planner Cloudflare assignment project.
Cloudflare encourages transparency in AI-assisted coding, so these are the main prompts and interactions that guided implementation.

1. Architecture & Project Setup

Prompt:
"How can I structure an AI travel planner using Cloudflare Workers, Workers AI, and Durable Objects?"

Prompt:
"Explain what components Cloudflare expects for the optional assignment."

Prompt:
"Help me break down the project into steps so I can build it myself."

2. Durable Object Implementation

Prompt:
"Write a simple Durable Object class that stores and retrieves travel history."

Prompt:
"How do I create a Memory Durable Object with state storage using Cloudflare Workers?"

3. Worker Logic & Routing

Prompt:
"Show me how to route requests for /generate and /memory inside a Worker."

Prompt:
"How can I call Workers AI (Llama model) from my Worker?"

4. Troubleshooting wrangler.toml

Prompt:
"My wrangler.toml is giving errors — what is the correct syntax for Durable Objects and AI bindings?"

Prompt:
"Fix: binding should have a string 'binding' field error in Wrangler."


5. Recruiter Communication

Prompt:
"Write a message to a recruiter explaining that I completed most of the optional assignment but missed the deadline."

Notes

All major design decisions and implementation steps were done manually by the developer.

AI assistance was used for troubleshooting, documentation polishing, and clarifying Cloudflare Worker configuration changes.

No code was copied from other Cloudflare assignment submissions.
