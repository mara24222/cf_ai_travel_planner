AI Travel Planner – Cloudflare Workers + Workers AI + Durable Objects
Overview

I LOVE to travel so I wanted to do something I am passionate about. I am no where near done as finals week is about to begin and this has been a busy semester, but I hope to get back to this cool Full Stack Project as soon as I am done, I used alot of AI to help me get started but once I have the time, I hope to come back to this and do it on my own to learn and grow from this project!!!

AI Travel Planner is a serverless application built on Cloudflare Workers, Workers AI, and Durable Objects.
It allows a user to input a travel destination and receive an AI-generated itinerary that includes:

Day-by-day travel plan

Hotel recommendations

Activities & food suggestions

Budget estimates

Safety & transportation tips

Persistent history of past travel requests

The project demonstrates how to coordinate AI workflows, storage, and request handling on Cloudflare’s edge platform.
